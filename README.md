## Set Up | Install From Chrome Store
1. Make sure you've added [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) to Chrome. 

2. Install [React Sight](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-sight/aalppolilappfakpmdfdkpppdnhpgifn) from the Chrome web store

3. If you are running local file URLs, make sure to enable "Allow access to file URLs" in the extension settings for both React Dev Tools and React Sight

4. Run your React application, or open (almost!) any website running React!

5. Open Chrome Developer Tools (cmd+opt+j) -> React Sight panel

## Building Your Own Version
If you'd like to build your own version of React Sight:

1. Clone the repo and `npm install` dependancies

2. Use `npm start` to generate the build 

3. In Chrome, open the extensions tab and click 'Load Unpacked Extension'. Load the folder '~/ReactSight/chrome-ext'

If you have any additional questions send us a message at reactsight@gmail.com :)

## Usage
Hover over nodes to see their state and props in the side panel. 

Hide DOM elements, Redux components, and Router components with the built in filters, so that you can focus only on the components you've written

Zoom in by double clicking, and zoom out by shift + double clicking (mousewheel zoom coming soon!)

## Why?

We built React Sight because there are no tools on the market that give you a visual representation of the structure of your App. When we were developing our own projects, we wished we had a way to see how everything was structured.

We wanted React Sight to be simple to use, which is why all you have to do is install a Chrome extension. No modifying your existing code!
